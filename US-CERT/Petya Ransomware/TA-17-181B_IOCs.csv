It uses the EternalBlue SMB exploit, and it attempts to steal a user's credentials via the Windows protected storage area. The malware will then attempt to use the stolen credentials to gain access to other systems on the local network. It installs a modified copy of the Mimikatz tool [MD5 7e37ab34ecdcc3e77e24522ddfd4852d] on a compromised system."

The ransomware will execute this modified Mimikatz binary using a command line argument, which will allow the malware to control the Mimikatz binary through a named pipe in virtual memory. The Mimikatz binary has been modified to prevent it from operating normally through STDOUT via the command line. Mimikatz is a tool that can be used to attain a user's credentials (username and password) from a Windows system. In this case, it is likely the malware using these stolen credentials to spread across a network. However, US-CERT did not directly observe this activity within the lab environment."
